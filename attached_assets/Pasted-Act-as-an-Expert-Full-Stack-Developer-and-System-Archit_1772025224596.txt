Act as an Expert Full-Stack Developer and System Architect. I am building a "Fantasy 5-a-side Football" web application for local matches, fully inspired by Fantasy Premier League (FPL) mechanics.

Development Environment Context:
I will be using the Replit Free tier strictly as my development IDE, not for production hosting. To ensure Replit runs smoothly during development without running out of memory:

The frontend and backend should be modular but manageable within a single Replit workspace (or suggest the best Replit configuration for this).

We MUST use an external, free cloud database (like Supabase or Neon Serverless Postgres) so we don't host the DB locally on Replit.

Modern Technology Stack:

Frontend: Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui.

Backend: Python with FastAPI (ideal for fast execution of the points engine and scalable for future smart analytics/AI integrations).

Database: PostgreSQL (hosted on Supabase or Neon) with SQLAlchemy or SQLModel in Python.

Authentication: JWT-based auth via FastAPI, or Supabase Auth.

Core Features & Fantasy Mechanics:

Roles: Admin (manages real players, prices, and match stats) and Fantasy Manager (users).

Squad Rules: Users select exactly 5 players (e.g., 1 GK, 2 DEF, 2 ATT) within a virtual budget (e.g., 50M). Prices are dynamic.

Gameplay: 1 free transfer per matchweek (extra deducts points). Users must select a Captain (points x2).

Points Engine: Robust Python logic to calculate points based on 5-a-side events (e.g., GK clean sheet = 5 pts, Goal = 4 pts, Assist = 3 pts, MVP = 3 pts, Nutmeg/Skill = 1 pt).

Social: Global leaderboard and private Mini-leagues with join codes.

UI/UX: Mobile-first, dark mode, vibrant sports aesthetic. Essential: A visual "Pitch View" component showing the user's 5 selected players positioned on a mini football field.

Output Request:

Detail the optimal Folder Structure for running Next.js and FastAPI together in Replit.

Provide the PostgreSQL Database Schema (SQLModel/SQLAlchemy) for Users, Players, FantasyTeams, Gameweeks, and MatchStats.

Write the FastAPI Python logic for the Points Calculation Engine.

Provide the React/Tailwind code for the interactive "Pitch View" component.

Provide the replit.nix or startup bash script needed to run both the Next.js dev server and the FastAPI uvicorn server simultaneously in Replit.
